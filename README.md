# Hyrule Heroes

Hyrule Heroes is a turn-based CLI game inspired by "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild". Players can choose from various champions and battle against the evil Ganon in a strategic turn-based combat system.

This code was created for my Module 02 - Advaced Python project at the end of the first month of my Coding Temple software development bootcamp.  While fully functional "as is", I hope to revisit it at a later date to add additional battle options, more characters, and also to clean up my code for a better user interface when the program is run in the terminal.  

If you have any suggestions or enhancement ideas, please feel free to reach out and let me know!
